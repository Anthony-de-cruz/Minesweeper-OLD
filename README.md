    Game win screen

Game statistics:

    Time(improvement),
    Number of mines remaining,
    Total Flags,
    Dimentions

Mine generation overhaul:

    Balance an actually good number of mines,
    Make sure mines spawn in completable formations (such as 9 mines in a 3x3 space)
    
Difficulties:

    Mine densities ect
    
Graphics overhaul:
